        <h2 id="about-me">
          This past summer, I worked in a team with three other interns as part
          of the Booz Allen Hamilton Summer Games program in order to design and
          develop an AI-forward search engine for internal clients in 9 weeks.
          Read more about the project below.

          Search engines are still a relatively new technology, and present
          daily issues to users in regard to
          <b
            >specificity of search, phrasing of search, and the sheer number of
            search results.</b
          >
          Similarly, my client team is relatively new, and they are still
          working to <b>structure and organize</b> the incredibly significant
          data that they are researching and recording that impacts the entire
          firm.

          In order to combat these issues, my team created Far Sight. Far Sight
          works to provide an optimized search experience for the client team by
          creating an <b>intelligent search engine</b> used to navigate research
          and related data by utilizing
          <b
            >forward-leaning artificial intelligence and automation
            algorithms.</b

        <h2 class="desc">
          As the front-end lead, I wanted to ensure our project was minimalistic
          while still fulfilling all of the users' needs. To do this, I surveyed
          the members of my client team to gather user requirements and also
          performed some basic A/B testing with Figma prototypes when deciding
          between features. This resulted in a clean, sophisticated display with
          simplistic navigation and a cohesive color scheme to match the
          company.

        <h2 class="desc">
          Throughout the summer, I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in
          order to fully develop our final prototype on the front-end. I also
          learned Flask to help link the front-end with the back-end, which
          allowed me to display applicable results, filter relevant data
          entries, link the URLs from the dataset to their external source, and
          create toggle and tag features for even further customization.

        <h2 class="desc">
          I worked closely with the back-end developers in order to create the
          search algorithms and fine-tune the AI model we selected from
          HuggingFace. This, along with the connectivity via Flask, allowed us
          to create a breadth-first search styled after the concept of neural
          networks.
