        <h2 id="about-me">
          As part of my Human Computer Interactions course in Fall 2021, I
          worked with four others as project manager on a semester-long project
          to compile the University of Virginia's resources for new students in
          a mobile application.

        <h2 class="desc">
          Transfers, first-years, and anyone new to the University of Virginia
          all experience some degree of difficulty integrating into the school.
          Where this be not knowing where to eat, confusion about the best path
          to take to get to class, or in a more broad scope, needing to learn
          more about the school, many students encounter
          <b>trouble locating useful University resources</b>.

        <h4 class="label">Solution</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          In order to combat this entry confusion, my team created HooKnows, a
          mobile application powered by upperclassmen that is designed to
          provide incoming students with all of the University's helpful
          information in addition to subjective information that is difficult to
          find in University-sponsored resources.

        <h4 class="label">User-Certified Features</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          In selecting the features for HooKnows, we wanted to get input from a
          number of different students on what would be most helpful for them.
          To do this, I interviewed first years and transfer students on what
          they have struggled with most in their transition to University life.
          This led us to choose five tabs for the application: Q&A, Dining,
          Housing, University Map, and Reviews, which were supported by each of
          our interviewees.

      <div class="words">
        <h4 class="label">Upperclassmen Retention</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          Since HooKnows is dependent on input from upperclassmen to provide
          subjective resources, we also wanted to ensure the features encouraged
          upperclassmen to use the application. Our initial proposal for
          HooKnows included a "Things to Bring" tab in place of "Housing," but
          after interviewing upperclassmen I quickly realized a "Housing"
          feature would be much more useful in the long-run and therefore
          encourage upperclassmen to keep the app as they become more
          knowledgeable about the University.

      <div class="words">
        <h4 class="label">Interface Consistency</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          With the number of tabs and information included in HooKnows, we
          wanted to ensure the interface remained easily navigable and intuitive
          to the user. Thus, in the application design we kept all of the
          selectable features a consistent light blue color and kept the home
          screen of almost every tab as a scrollable page of blue preview
          bubbles that highlight key information.
