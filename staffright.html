        <h2 id="about-me">
          As part of my User Experience Design course in Spring 2022, I worked
          with two others on a 4-week project for Deloitte redesigning their
          project assignment tool, StaffRight.

        <h2 class="desc">
          StaffRight, Deloitte's recently developed team placement application,
          was implemented in order to match new hires to their best-fit project
          while reducing implicit bias. However, the current system is difficult
          to navigate due to overwhelming amounts of
          <b>irrelevant information</b> and
          <b>fails to prioritize an individual's interests</b> in the selection
          process.

      <div class="words">
        <h4 class="label">Solution</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          My team's redesign aimed to streamline the design, showing the
          information that matters most for project fit, while also highlighting
          a candidate's interest and skill matches to ensure hiring managers are
          truly selecting the best candidate for a position.

        <h4 class="label">Workflow Definition and Navigation</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          One of the main flaws of the original system was the navigation.
          Understanding where to find essential information was nearly
          impossible, and understanding the “selection” of a candidate was also
          incredibly confusing. My team modified the navigation and the workflow
          to ensure users can easily locate the page they need and allow hiring
          managers and the candidate to pick their best fit.

        <h4 class="label">Restructuring Data</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          The original display of the “Best Fit Candidates” page primarily
          contained information nonessential to the hiring process, most notably
          the numerous columns that reiterated the entry level of the candidate
          in different phrasing. In order to correct this, my redesign
          prioritizes the key hiring criteria: skills, interests, and each of
          their fit to the project. I also kept the previously used FitScore for
          experienced users, and added an info button for newer users to learn
          about the variable.
