        <h2 id="about-me">
          As part of my User Experience Design course in Spring 2022, I worked
          with two others on a 4-week project for WillowTree designing a new
          trip planning feature for their mobile application, Sun Outdoors.

        <h2 class="desc">
          Sun Communities works to appeal to adventerous travelers that enjoy
          visiting scenic locations across the United States by providing
          convenient booking of country-wide camping and RV sites. As part of
          their next steps towards
          <b>bolstering their mobile application and attracting new users</b>,
          they wish to design a trip planner that allows the user to take the
          stress out of trip planning while promoting in-house properties.

        <h4 class="label">Solution</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          My team worked to design a comprehensive trip planner that allows
          users to imagine their journey without the over-stimulation of
          competing trip planners. The planner provides flexibility to a variety
          of users, whether they know exactly where they want to go or need some
          inspiration to begin planning.

        <h4 class="label">User Flexibility</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          In designing the trip planner, I wanted to ensure users had the
          abilitiy to utilize the planner even if they didn’t have the exact
          details of their trip narrowed down. Thus, I created a “smart
          suggestions” feature that users can toggle to find popular attractions
          along their route. These can be tapped to view details about the spot,
          and can quickly be added to the trip (or removed from the
          suggestions). I also worked with my teammates to create flexible
          options for location and time frame, using interests and
          approximations to auto-generate a trip for the user.

        <h4 class="label">Brand Promotion</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          While the trip planner is intended for use by anyone, whether booking
          through Sun Outdoors or not, I still wanted to ensure the company’s
          properties were being promoted. I accomplished this by creating and
          emphasizing a “Start Booking” page after finalizing a trip, which
          suggests properties close to each stop of the trip. I also created a
          share functionality for trips in order to expand outreach and attract
          a larger user base.

        <h4 class="label">Design Accessibility</h4>
        <h2 class="desc">
          A key focus of our final design was accessibility, especially in terms
          of color. One of Sun Outdoor’s primary colors is a yellow-orange
          shade, and is used for many of the interactable features. However, the
          color is difficult to see in contrast with the pale background, so our
          team restructured the color palette to make better use of the darker
          secondary colors and ensure the key features were visible to all
          users.
